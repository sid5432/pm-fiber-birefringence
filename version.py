"""
2014-12-04: Add display of shear stress (sigma_xy) in X-Y plot.
2014-12-03: Fix delta n formula.  Split stress-optic coefficients to C1 and C2, instead of combined
            C=C2-C1.  Update help file with additional references and notes.  Add switch to plot
            either tension or delta n in the X-Y plot and the cross-section plot.
2014-12-01: Major fixes in formulas.  More renaming of modules..
2014-11-30: Add bow-tie stress calculation; name change to include both panda and bow-tie fibers.
2014-11-22: Add stress tensor visualization and update help section.
2014-11-20: Add thermal expansion coefficient estimator.  Set default boron concentration at
            20%.
2014-11-18: Add export functions.
2014-11-17: Completion of GUI, plots, and most functions.
